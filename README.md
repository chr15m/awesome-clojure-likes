Mapping the constellation of [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure)-like programming languages.

[Contribute](./contributing.md).

## Official variants

 * [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) on the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).
 * [Clojure CLR](https://clojure.org/about/clojureclr) on the [Common Language Runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime).
 * [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) in the browser.
