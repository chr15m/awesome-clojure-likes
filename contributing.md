### Criteria for inclusion

 * It is a LISP.
 * The documentation states it is inspired by Clojure.

Probably has one or more of the following properties:

 * Shares some syntactic shortcuts of Clojure (e.g. `[]`, `{}`, `#{}`, `#()`)
 * Preference for immutable datastructures (probably trie based).
 * Language uses builtin names that are closer to Clojure than to other LISPs.

Basically if it looks and smells like Clojure then it's a candidate for inclusion.
