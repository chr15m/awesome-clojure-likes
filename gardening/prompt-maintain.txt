Please help us maintain this list of awesome clojure-like languages.
The main document is the README which lists the languages.
Tasks:

- Project descriptions should be up to date and concise but informational.
- The maintainance status of each project should be noted in cases where a project is not receiving regular updates.
- Projects should appear in the README with rough order of active projects at the start and higher popularity first.
- Ignore the "Mal" section and any project which doesn't have a GitHub.

Make sure you have the latest data before making changes. Don't just make changes based on your internal knowledge of a project.

You can get current project READMEs with this script: `./gardening/fetch-readme org/repo`.

You can get the latest data about projects using the script `gardening/fetch-repo-details org/repo org-2/repo-2 ...`.
You can pass it multiple repos like this:

$ ./gardening/fetch-repo-details "carp-lang/Carp" "hylang/hy" "babashka/babashka"

GitHub Repository Star Counts:
==============================
- carp-lang/Carp
{
  "stars": ...,
  "pushed": ...
}
- hylang/hy
{
  "stars": ...,
  "pushed": ...
}
- babashka/babashka
{
  "stars": ...,
  "pushed":...l
}

Start by listing the org/repo name of the all projects in the README which have a GitHub repo.
